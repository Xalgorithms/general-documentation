# Format

Individual contributors are strongly encouraged to keep a journal. This helps
the collective to understand - asynchronously - where contributions and changes
are active. It also helps retain a *train of thought* between contributors
during periods where one or the other may not be actively contributing. These
journals should follow a format that is *preferred by the contributor*. The only
requirement is that some sort of timestamp be provided with new entries so that
other contributors can effectively assess the current activity of the author.
