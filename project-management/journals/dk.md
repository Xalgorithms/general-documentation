This week, I finalized *v0.0.3* of Interlibr. It's not the most polished
release, but preparing it has allow me to *finally* think about our release
process. I decided on Friday to start adding a little more structure to the
development work. This will hopefully allow us to manage the async, often
non-overlapping, contributions from others. Certainly the v0.0.3 release *does
not* follow the [structure I've proposed](../releases.md), but at least it's a
start.
